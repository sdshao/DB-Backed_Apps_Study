Motivation: improve page loading time
Cost estimator: 
1. A real testing workload, logging down execution time.
2. Static estimation, not accurate.
Optimization suggestion:
1. Pagination.
2. Asynchronous loading
3. Approximation, probably count operation.
4. Remove some contents.
Interface design:
1. Cost estimation heat map: dynamic profiling results and statically estimated results. Not describe how to determine the degree of the heat map.
2. Optimization suggestion.
Evaluation:
1. How many opportunities does Panorama identify.
2. How much performance benefits.
3. Are alternate view designs worthwhile.
4. How accurate is the Panorama estimator.

Things are not clear to me:
How are the estimation costs are sorted? How to determine the cost will go to low, middle or high category.
The static cost estimation cost is not accurate, especially when the queries in the same page retrieves data from different tables.
The relationship between cost estimation and optimization is not clear to me. To me, cost estimation is used as a reference to see if the optimization is needed. But it seems not the case in the paper.
